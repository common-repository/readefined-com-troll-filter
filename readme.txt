INTRODUCTION
------------

Readefined's tracker can tell if somebody is paying attention to a piece of content, and how intensely. This plugin uses that tech to make sure your comments section is only accessible to readers who paid enough attention. Trolls and knee-jerk commenters will need to properly read your content before they can share their two cents. The plugin is free to use, and you can unlock many additional features at Readefined.com.


Usage Requirements
--------------------------

Your comments section must be wrapped in a parent container with the CSS ID "post-comments" or the CSS class "post-comments".


Privacy
--------------------------

Due to GDPR, you must first register an account at readefined.com/trollfilter.
